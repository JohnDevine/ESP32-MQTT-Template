# Version 1.3.1 - Configuration Improvements

## Overview

Version 1.3.1 focuses on improving the reliability and usability of the web configuration interface, particularly for WiFi setup. The main changes involve simplifying the WiFi configuration process and adding pack name functionality.

## Major Changes

### 1. WiFi Configuration Simplification

**Problem Solved:**
- Previous versions used WiFi network scanning with dropdown selection
- This caused intermittent reliability issues and configuration failures
- Users experienced difficulties when WiFi networks weren't detected

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed all WiFi scanning and dropdown functionality
- Replaced with simple text input field for manual SSID entry
- Eliminated complex JavaScript for scan/manual toggle logic

**Benefits:**
- More reliable configuration process
- Faster setup (no waiting for scans)
- Works consistently regardless of network visibility
- Reduced code complexity and potential failure points

### 2. Pack Name Configuration

**New Feature:**
- Added pack name field to web configuration interface
- Pack name appears as first field in MQTT JSON payload
- Stored persistently in NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)

**MQTT Integration:**
```json
{
  "pack": {
    "packName": "MyBatteryPack",  // New field - first in pack object
    "packV": 13.28,
    "packA": 0.0,
    // ... other pack data
  }
}
```

**Default Behavior:**
- Default pack name: "BatteryPack"
- Configurable via web interface
- Persists across reboots and firmware updates

## Technical Implementation

### Code Changes

#### Main Firmware (`src/main.c`)
- **Added:** Pack name NVS storage and retrieval
- **Modified:** MQTT JSON generation to include pack name
- **Removed:** WiFi scan handler and related functions
- **Fixed:** Pack name positioning in JSON structure

#### Web Interface (`data/parameters.html`)
- **Simplified:** WiFi SSID input (removed dropdown)
- **Added:** Pack name input field
- **Removed:** WiFi scan, dropdown, and toggle JavaScript
- **Streamlined:** Form handling and configuration loading

### NVS Storage Schema
- **Key:** `pack_name`
- **Type:** String
- **Default:** "BatteryPack"
- **Max Length:** 32 characters

### Web Interface Fields
```html
<!-- New simplified WiFi configuration -->
<input type="text" id="ssid" placeholder="Enter WiFi Network Name">

<!-- New pack name configuration -->
<input type="text" id="packName" placeholder="Battery Pack Name">
```

## Upgrade Instructions

### From Version 1.3.0 to 1.3.1

1. **Upload New Firmware:**
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload
   ```

2. **Upload New Web Interface:**
   ```bash
   pio run --target uploadfs
   ```

3. **Reconfigure WiFi (if needed):**
   - Enter configuration mode (hold boot button on startup)
   - Manually enter your WiFi SSID (no dropdown available)
   - Set pack name if desired (optional)

### Configuration Migration
- **WiFi Settings:** SSID and password are preserved
- **MQTT Settings:** All MQTT configuration remains unchanged
- **Pack Name:** Will default to "BatteryPack" until configured

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (v1.3.0)
```
1. Enter configuration mode
2. Wait for WiFi scan to complete
3. Select network from dropdown (if detected)
4. Or toggle to manual mode if scan fails
5. Enter password and other settings
```

### After (v1.3.1)
```
1. Enter configuration mode
2. Type WiFi network name directly
3. Enter password and other settings
4. Set pack name (optional)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue:** WiFi network not connecting after upgrade
**Solution:** Re-enter configuration mode and manually type the exact SSID

**Issue:** Pack name not appearing in MQTT
**Solution:** Check that pack name is configured in web interface and saved

**Issue:** Configuration page looks different
**Solution:** This is expected - the interface has been simplified for better reliability

## Backward Compatibility

### MQTT Data Structure
- **Existing fields:** All remain unchanged
- **New pack name field:** Added as first field in "pack" object
- **Existing consumers:** Will continue to work without modification
- **New integrations:** Can utilize pack name for better organization

### Configuration Values
- **WiFi credentials:** Preserved during upgrade
- **MQTT settings:** Unchanged
- **Sample interval:** Preserved
- **BMS topic:** Preserved

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
- WiFi signal strength indicator
- Network connectivity testing
- Pack name validation
- Configuration backup/restore

### Known Limitations
- No WiFi network discovery (by design)
- Manual SSID entry required
- Pack name limited to 32 characters

## Version History Context

| Version | WiFi Configuration | Pack Name | Key Changes |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 1.2.1   | Dropdown scan     | Not available | Basic functionality |
| 1.3.0   | Dropdown scan     | Not available | Enhanced BMS data |
| 1.3.1   | Manual text entry | Available | Reliability improvements |

## Documentation Updates

Files updated in this release:
- `README.md` - Updated configuration instructions
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v1.3.1 release notes
- `version.txt` - Version bumped to 1.3.1
- `data/version.txt` - Version bumped to 1.3.1

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Deployment
1. Test WiFi configuration with various SSID formats
2. Verify pack name persistence across reboots
3. Confirm MQTT JSON structure includes pack name
4. Test configuration interface on different devices

### After Deployment  
1. Monitor system stability
2. Verify MQTT publishes include pack name
3. Check configuration interface accessibility
4. Confirm automatic reconnection after power cycle

This release represents a significant improvement in system reliability and user experience, focusing on the core functionality that users depend on most.
