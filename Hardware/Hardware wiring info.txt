This explains the ESP end of the pins on the MAX485 breakout board
NOTE: to enable the reciever you need to pull RE low (earth)
    to enable the transmitter you need to pull DE high (+3)

    I have only enabled the reciever but I send data and get a response so who knows

Pin  Name              Direction   Description
RO - Receiver Output - Output -    The data received from the RS-485 bus (A/B) comes out here — connect to your MCU’s RX.
RE - Receiver Enable - Input -     Active low — pull LOW to enable receiving (activates RO). Pull HIGH to disable the receiver.
DE - Driver Enable -   Input -     Active high — pull HIGH to enable transmission (activates DI to A/B). Pull LOW to disable transmitter.
DI - Driver Input -    Input -     The data you want to send goes here — connect to your MCU’s TX.
